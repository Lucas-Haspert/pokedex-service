As a best practise software develepment industry use a well-organized folder structure to improves code maintainability, collaboration among team members, and the overall development process.
Here are some key reasons why the Spring Boot folder structure is important:

Clarity and Organization
Clear Layout: A well-defined folder structure provides a clear layout of where to find different components of your application.
Efficiency: It makes it easier for developers to locate specific files, packages, and resources, reducing the time spent searching for code.

Modularity
Logical Components: Spring Boot follows a modular approach, dividing the application into different logical components like controllers, services, repositories, and configurations.
Effective Organization: A proper folder structure allows you to organize these components effectively, making the application easier to understand and maintain.

Separation of Concerns
Focused Development: The folder structure enforces a separation of concerns, allowing developers to focus on specific parts of the application without worrying about unrelated code.
Layered Architecture: For example, business logic resides in the service layer, data access code in the repository layer, and web request handling in the controller layer.

Scalability
Growth Management: As the application grows, a well-organized folder structure makes it easier to accommodate new features and functionalities.
Coherent Architecture: It facilitates the addition of new modules or components while maintaining a coherent overall architecture.

Code Reusability
Reusable Components: Proper organization encourages the creation of reusable components.
Reduced Duplication: When developers can easily find and understand existing code, they are more likely to reuse it instead of duplicating efforts.

Ease of Collaboration
Consistency: When multiple developers work on a project, adhering to a standardized folder structure ensures consistency and facilitates collaboration.
Quick Locating: Everyone on the team knows where to place new code and can quickly locate code added by others.

Build and Deployment
Predictable Structure: Tools like build systems, continuous integration, and deployment scripts can take advantage of a predictable folder structure.
Automation: It helps automate the build and deployment processes efficiently.

Testing and Debugging
Simplified Testing: An organized folder structure makes it simpler to write tests and debug the application.
Test Coverage: Test classes and resources can be placed alongside the corresponding classes, making it easy to understand the test suite’s coverage.

Onboarding New Team Members
Quick Integration: When new developers join the team, a well-defined folder structure helps them get up to speed quickly.
Architecture Understanding: They can quickly understand the architecture and locate relevant code sections.

Maintainable Codebase
Long-term Maintenance: A clean and well-structured codebase is easier to maintain in the long run.
Reduced Technical Debt: It reduces technical debt and makes it less likely to introduce bugs or regressions when making changes.

Here I’m going to explain the files that need to include above folders:

Config:
Contains configuration classes, where you configure application settings, or AppConfig for other application-level configurations.

Controller:
Contains your RESTful controller classes. These classes handle incoming HTTP requests and define the API endpoints.

DTO (Data Transfer Object):
A DTO, is a design pattern used to transfer data between different layers or components of an application.
The main purpose of a DTO is to encapsulate data and provide a simple data structure that can be easily passed around the application.
DTOs are often used to transfer data between the front-end and back-end of a web application, between microservices, or between different layers of an application, like the service layer and the presentation layer.

Enum (Enumeration class):
Enum classes are typically used to represent a set of closely related and pre-defined values.
Examples of common use cases for Enum classes include request status like SUCCESS, FAIL, PENDING and more.

Model:
The model folder stores data models or entities that represent structure and behaviour of the application domain.
These classes are mapped to database tables and define the properties and relationships of the application data.

Repository:
Contains repository classes that deal with data access.
These classes typically use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework or JPA (Java Persistence API) to interact with the database.

Service:
Contains service classes that implement business logic.
Controllers use these services to perform operations on data.

Util (Utilities):
The “util” folder is not specific to Spring Boot; it is a general practice followed in many programming languages and frameworks.
In Spring Boot projects, you might find a “util” package or folder where developers place utility classes to keep the codebase organized and modular.
